## What have i learned about C

- Functions must be declared in order or forward-declared (prototypes). 
- No overloading - you must write seperate versions for `int`, `double`, etc.
- Arrays decay to pointers when passed to functions - size must be passed seperatly.
- The C math library provides many useful functions such as `sin`, `cos`, `sqrt`, etc. 
- `M_PI` os defined in many systems and doesn't need to be calculated manually.
