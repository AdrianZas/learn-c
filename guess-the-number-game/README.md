## Rules of the Game

- The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- You have unlimited attempts to guess the number.
- After each guess:
  - If your guess is more than 10 away from the number â†’ **Cold**
  - If your guess is within Â±10 of the number â†’ **Hot**
  - If your guess is correct â†’ **You win! ðŸŽ‰**

## Concepts Used

This project demonstrates the following C programming concepts:

- `printf()` / `scanf()` â€“ for input and output
- `rand()` and `srand()` â€“ for generating random numbers
- `time()` â€“ for random seed initialization
- `if/else` and logical operators
- Custom functions and return values
- Loop control using `while (true)`
